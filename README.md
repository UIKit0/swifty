##SpriteKit Flappy Bird like game prototype in Swift

**swifty** is a prototype game written in Apple's new programming language, Swift.

I wrote this to go through the exercise of thinking out a simple game I might write
in Objective-C in the new language. 

This game is a prototype with unfinished features and functionality. I also haven't 
impelemented any addon features yet like GameKit, iAd or iCloud. I might get the bug 
to do that later, for now this was really just for playing with Swift.

**swifty** is known to compile and run fine on OSX 10.10 (Yosemite), the iOS8 Simulator
and devices running iOS8 beta.
