##SpriteKit Flappy Bird like game prototype in Swift

*swifty* is a prototype game written in Apple's new programming language, Swift.

I wrote this to go through the exercise of thinking out a simple game I might write
in Objective-C in a while new language. 

This game is a prototype with unfinished features and functionality. 

It is known to compile and run fine on OSX 10.10 (Yosemite), the iOS8 Simulator
and devices running iOS8 beta.
